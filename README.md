# SHREDDIT

Shreddit is a forum built entirely on Rails and contains some cool little features that test the limits of coding without any sort of asyncronous rendering :D

Shreddit's has forums, posts and comments. Users can create posts in a forum, and forum admins can delete comments or posts for anyone in their forum. 

When posting, users have access to a rich text editor built on Campfire's trix.

Users can also like posts, which forces a page reload because we're limiting our JS.

The CSS is also entirely custom and object oriented, shoutout to Eric Bailey's Svbstrate.

Lastly there are numerous validations, user auth and profile photos utilizing active storage.
